### What did you do this past week?

This was a pretty uninteresting week. The highlight of my week would probably be a short trip to San Antonio to see friends and pick up a few things I had left at home.

### What's in your way?

It seems like UT has made a change to how the campus VPN works, and although it works fine on one of my older devices, I can't get my main working computer to connect to it. I've spent a lot of time trying to troubleshoot it, but now I've kind of given up on trying to figure it out on my own and I'm just waiting for a response from the IT help desk.

My Medium account also got suspended, and I can't seem to hold a decent connection to my apartment's wifi. Lots of frustrating tech troubles this week.

### What will you do next week?

My friend and I have birthdays very close to each other and they're coming up in a few weeks, so it's probably time to reach out and figure out something to do. Additionally, I'm hoping to finish a small personal project I've been working on and maybe polish it so that some friends can use it as well.

### What did you think of Paper \#2, Makefile?

It was pretty interesting. Makefiles seem like a super useful tool to incorporate into my workflows that involve lots of repeated commands. I'll have to think more about good ways to utilize them in future projects.

### What did you think of Docker, assertions, and unit tests?

I'm glad to be learning about and working with Docker. It previously seemed like this big mysterious thing that I saw lots of people using but that I never really understood, and I'm glad to be chipping away at that mystery. *(It kind of reminds me of Git in that sense.)*

I can mostly say the same about unit tests as well. I've gotten used to using assertions for pre- and post-conditions, but I'd never really thought about their drawbacks, and as a result I never found much motivation to use unit testing software. It still feels a little cumbersome to write unit tests, but I think that'll become a little easier as I grow more familiar with it.

### What made you happy this week?

The Spurs got two wins! *(That's been pretty rare so far this season.)*

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

This isn't specific to software development, though I think anyone who works with computers will find it useful:

*Software sucks.* Sometimes things break or fail or become corrupted. *(Case in point: my VPN, Medium, and wifi troubles.)* Have backup plans ready for when things go wrong - you might not need them most of the time, but when you do, you'll be incredibly glad to have them.

Furthermore, if you find yourself writing software, think carefully about how your programs handle failures and how you can make that experience a little less frustrating for the user. Unforunately doing this well will often go unnoticed, but you can be assured that doing so poorly will be noticed ardently.
