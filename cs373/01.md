**Where did you grow up? What high school did you attend? What was your favorite extracurricular activity in high school?**

I grew up in San Antonio, Texas, and I attended the South San Antonio Early College Academy. My favorite extracurricular activity was competing in the FIRST Robotics Competition.

**Why did you come to UT? Why are you majoring in CS?**

I decided to come to UT since it's relatively close to home and a strong school for computer science. I've been programming since I was 11, and although I also found mechanical engineering interesting in high school, I ultimately decided to go with CS.

**Why are you in this class? What are your expectations of this class?**

There were quite a few courses that I found interesting, but the deciding factor for this one was a recommendation from a friend. I'm looking forward to gaining more experience with programming, especially working on a more meaningful project compared to those from previous courses that were perhaps more educational in nature.

**How much do you know about Javascript/Python/SQL/Web programming?**

I've worked a little with JavaScript and Python, but they are essentially new languages to me. I have some experience with SQL and web programming, particularly in PHP with Laravel, but that was all from 6+ years ago, so it's quite rusty.

**How did you like the first lectures? How did you feel about the cold calling?**

The first lectures were good. They did well to set up the expectations of what to do in the class, but I do wish we had discussed what the course material might look like, even if just at a high level. Additionally there was a lot of overlap between the first lectures of this class and of OOP, which is also taught by Dr. Downing and is structured similarly, but that's to be expected. I don't have any strong feelings about the cold calling. I think it helps folks stay more engaged and helps us learn more about our classmates which is nice, though I also understand that it can be stressful for some.

**What do you think about specifications grading?**

Again, I'm fresh out of OS, so the grading scheme is familiar. I think I slightly prefer it over percentage grading, but I haven't put much thought into it. I will note that it's very nice that the total amount of points available in each category is provided upfront â€” this was my biggest gripe with my previous experience with it.

**What made you happy this week?**

My friend's cat, Sumo. (Cats are what make me happy most weeks.)

**My pick-of-the-week:**

One of my favorite games is Factorio, a game about automation and logistics. There are many parallels between the game and software development or computer engineering. For example, it's often useful to divide your factory into many smaller parts and think about the inputs and outputs of each individual piece. Another example might be figuring out how to design a many-to-many train network to meet the supply-and-demand needs of each node in the network, which draws parallels with ideas like networking, relational databases, and even race conditions and deadlock. It's a very fun game for many software engineers, but beware that it's very easy to lose track of time while playing.
